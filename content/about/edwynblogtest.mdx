# Edwin blog post test
 
This is a test page for creating markdown content related to a blog post.

## A IIIF Viewer
 
The `<Viewer />` is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the
IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is
responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in. These Manifests can be part of the Canopy
source Collection but are not limited to it.
 
<Viewer iiifContent="https://stage-sites.dlib.nyu.edu/viewer/api/presentation/photos/fales_mss208_cuid4772/manifest.json" />
