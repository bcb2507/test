# Edwin blog post test
 
This is a test page for creating markdown content related to a blog post.

## A IIIF Viewer
 
The `<Viewer />` is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in. These Manifests can be part of the Canopy source Collection but are not limited to it.
 
<Viewer iiifContent="https://stage-sites.dlib.nyu.edu/viewer/api/presentation/photos/fales_mss208_cuid4772/manifest.json" />

## Referenced Items
 
The `<ReferencedItems />` automatically outputs a grid of items that are referenced by the current page.
 
<ReferencedItems />

## Leveraging Metadata

### Using the Viewer
 
The `<Viewer />` component supports IIIF Collections. This allows you to reference a IIIF Collection that is generated by Canopy IIIF. In this example, we are referencing a Collection of items that have a `date` of `1687`.
 
<Viewer iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1687-september-26.json" />
 
### Using the Slider
 
Alternatively, you can use the `<Slider />` component to render a carousel of items that link to the local relative `/work` pages representing the Manifests.
 
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/date/1687-september-26.json" />
